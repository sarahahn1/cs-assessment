Read over the results, and write a paragraph that explains the pattern you see. How does each function “scale”? Which of the two functions scales better? How can you tell?


The pattern that I see is that when the array's get larger and it eventually becomes larger than the function using .push. Therefore I say it is better to use the function with .push because the runtime is smaller that the other function. The reason why .unshift is not as good as function because it has to move all the numbers that are in the array which is the slowest solution.
